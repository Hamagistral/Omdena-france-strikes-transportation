## 🔬 Project Overview :

#### 🚇 Project background

The current social crisis in France is resulting in repetitive general strikes. These strikes often have a significant impact on transportation in Île-de-France. For example, train drivers’ strikes can lead to many train cancellations and the disturbance of transportation schedules. Strikes led by bus drivers, subway agents, and other public transport workers also lead to a significant disturbance whereas the citizens struggle to arrive at their workplaces, universities, etc.

#### ❔ The problem

During a strike day, users may struggle to find reliable and accurate information about alternative transportation in Ile-De-France. The current transportation infrastructure lacks an efficient and effective way to provide transport users with personalized information and assistance.

#### 🎯 Project goals

The goal of this project is to develop a chatbot application that helps the citizens in the Ile-De-France by providing them with reliable and accurate information about alternative transportation on strike days.
